          <p>There appears to  be a mild positive trend between the lack of healthcare (%) and poverty (%) for the states.
            It also appears that sample collected of each state tend to have a median age skewed to the right of 35 years and above.
            For lacks healthcare (%) vs median household income, no trend is evident.  </p>

          <p>The states which have a higher percentage of smokers also tend to have a higher poverty percentage. Although this statement 
            is not concrete and very strong, the positive correlation remains evident. The median age for a state and its smokers percentage 
            does not have much correlation between the two variables. Households tend to earn more for those households which don't have smokers 
            based on the resulting data sample. There is an evident negative linear correlation but does not appear to be very strong.
          </p>

          <p>There is a positive trend indicating that when there are higher levels of poverty, there are also higher levels (percentages) 
            of people who are obese. This begs the question - why are 'fatter' people in society more likely to have a lower income or be in poverty? 
            (or the other way around?) As such, we do keep in mind that correlation does not always imply causation but more research is required to answer
            my begging question.
